# Pitch please
A tool for more informed planning of sport pitches for maximum social impact.

## Overview
The App can be found in the `visualize` folder. It is a web app that allows you to visualize pitches relative to district population in Berlin.

In addition, we build a rooftop detector `rooftop_detection` that can be used to identifying relevant rooftops for pitches in your area of interest.
